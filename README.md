# Print-Relay-Server
**Print Relay** is an open-source, self-hosted platform for managing and sharing printers (and potentially other devices) across networks. Designed with modern technologies, it enables seamless device management, real-time communication, and collaborative printing workflows.

**Print Relay Self-Host** is the backbone of the Print Relay platform. It is an ASP.NET Core-based self-hosted server that manages devices, users, print jobs, and real-time communication between connected clients. Designed for scalability and extensibility, the self-hosted server allows seamless print sharing and job management.
